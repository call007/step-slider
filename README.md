# Step Slider

A lightweight step-based slider component for React. It snaps to
discrete values (“steps”), supports labels and marks, and feels great with
mouse and touch.

## Why this exists

Most sliders focus on continuous values. This one is designed for **clear,
opinionated steps** (think: Off / Low / Medium / High) with a smooth UX and
first-class accessibility.

## Highlights

- **Discrete steps & snapping** — perfect for finite options and presets.
- **Labels & ticks** — show context at a glance.
- **Touch & mouse** — fluid dragging with helpful hit-areas.
- **Type-safe** — built with TypeScript.

## Quick start

```bash
# clone and run the demo locally
